Music Genre Classification Model: In this project, we compared MultiLayer Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network on their performance when dealing with music genre classification problems.

Comparison of Two Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: We compared the Episodic Semi-Gradient n-step SARSA algorithm with the True Online SARSA algorithm on two environments: 1. Cartpole 2. Mountain Car.
