Music Genre Classification Model: In this project, we compared MultiLayer Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network on their performance
                                  when dealing with music genre classification problems.

Comparison of Two Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: We compared
